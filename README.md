# 🎓 Student Clustering Project

## 📊 Overview
This project applies hierarchical clustering to student data to uncover distinct behavioral profiles.  
It explores how study hours, attendance, and motivation shape engagement patterns beyond exam scores.

## ✅ Steps
- Data scaling and preparation
- Dendrogram analysis to choose clusters
- Agglomerative clustering (Ward linkage)
- Cluster profiling with group means
- ANOVA tests for feature significance
- Scatter plot visualizations

## 🌼 Key Findings
- Study hours, attendance, and motivation differ significantly across clusters.
- Stress levels, assignment completion, and exam scores show no significant differences.
- Clusters reflect **engagement patterns** rather than performance outcomes.

## ⚙️ Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `scipy`, `matplotlib`

## ✨ Insight
Academic journeys are shaped more by **effort and presence** than by exam results.
